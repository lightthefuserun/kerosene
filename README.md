# Kerosene

Kerosene generates rails applications with the customs configuration used at [Light the Fuse and Run](https://www.lightthefuse.run/).

## Installation

Install the kerosene gem:

    gem install kerosene

## Usage

After installing kerosene, run:

    kerosene projectname

This will create a Rails app in `projectname` using the latest version of Rails.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
